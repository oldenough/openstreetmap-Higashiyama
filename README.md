## openstreetmap-Higashiyama
Last summer I wanted a tourist map of Kyoto for my Garmin or Android and couldn't find anything I really liked.

Google map was OK, but didn't work on the Garmin, and a downloaded map for Garmin from [Openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM) was missing too much, and the kanji defaulted to pinyen instead of romaji.  So, later, when I had more time, I started exploring what was going on, and discovered that a lot of information was missing from the the [Kyoto area](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/34.9942/135.7673) on OSM.  The other problem was that people were wildly inconsistent in how they used the name tag for streets and locations.  For example, if the name tag only included kanji, and there was no name:en tag, then the renderer defaulted to pinyen if you asked for the map to use English.

So, now I am trying to add information and clean up the tagging, starting in the Higashiyama ward which I know better than other areas.  I learn something new and... well, it beats playing Solitaire.
